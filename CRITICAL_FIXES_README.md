# Critical Issues Fix Documentation

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Security Issues
- ✅ Removed hardcoded credentials from AuthPage.tsx
- ✅ Created environment variables template
- ✅ Implemented proper logging levels

### 2. Code Quality Issues
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript configuration for stricter type checking
- ✅ Created shared validation schemas
- ✅ Implemented centralized error handling
- ✅ Added performance monitoring utilities
- ✅ Created feature flags configuration

### 3. Performance Issues
- ✅ Reduced excessive logging in production
- ✅ Added conditional logging for development only
- ✅ Created performance monitoring utilities

## Next Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
1. Copy .env.template to .env.local
2. Fill in your actual values
3. Never commit .env.local to version control

### 2. Testing
1. Test all authentication flows
2. Verify error handling works correctly
3. Check that logging is appropriate for each environment
4. Ensure TypeScript compilation works with new strict settings

### 3. Deployment
1. Update your deployment environment variables
2. Test in staging environment
3. Monitor for any new TypeScript errors
4. Verify performance improvements

## Remaining Issues

The following issues still need manual attention:

1. **TODO Comments**: Implement incomplete features in:
   - src/components/savings/SavingsAccountDetailsDialog.tsx
   - src/components/groups/GroupDetailsDialog.tsx

2. **RLS Policies**: Review and fix Supabase RLS policies for profiles table

3. **Component Optimization**: Break down large components and optimize re-renders

4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage

5. **Documentation**: Update API and component documentation
