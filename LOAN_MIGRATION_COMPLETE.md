   - Handles grace periods correctly
   - Generates accurate payment dates

3. **Updates Loan Data**
   - Replaces existing schedules with new ones
   - Updates outstanding balance and totals
   - Sets migration status and tracking
   - Adds periodic payment amount

4. **Updates Existing Payments**
   - Recalculates payment allocation using strategy
   - Updates principal, interest, fee, and penalty amounts
   - Maintains payment history integrity

5. **Harmonizes Data**
   - Calculates consistent outstanding balance
   - Determines days in arrears
   - Validates schedule consistency
   - Sets last and next payment dates
